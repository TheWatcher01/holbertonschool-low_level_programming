# Project: C - Hello, World

## Overview

This project focuses on introducing the C programming language, including its compilation process, syntax basics, and some fundamental functions for output.
By completing this project, participants are expected to understand why C is a powerful language, learn about its inventors, and grasp the compilation process.

## Curriculum

- **Module**: Foundations v2 - Part 1
- **Average**: 96.29%
- **Project Achievement**: Achieved (100%)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, learners should be able to:

- Describe the appeal of C programming.
- Identify key figures in C's history such as its inventor and influential contributors.
- Understand the process and components involved when compiling a C program using `gcc`.
- Recognize the entry point of a C program.
- Utilize `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` to output text.
- Use the `sizeof` operator to get the size of various data types.
- Compile C programs with `gcc` and understand the significance of compiler flags.
- Adhere to the Betty coding style for C programming.

## Requirements

### C

- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **Code Styling**: Betty coding style is mandatory.

### Shell Scripts

- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Scripts must be two lines long and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
