# C - Search Algorithms

This project is an exploration of search algorithms in C. It includes implementations of several search algorithms, as well as analyses of their time and space complexity.

## Project Files

- `0-linear.c` : Implementation of linear search algorithm
- `0-main.c` : Main file for testing linear search
- `1-binary.c` : Implementation of binary search algorithm
- `1-main.c` : Main file for testing binary search
- `2-O` : Time complexity of linear search
- `3-O` : Space complexity of linear search
- `4-O` : Time complexity of binary search
- `5-O` : Space complexity of binary search
- `6-O` : Space complexity of a specific function
- `search_algos.h` : Header file containing function prototypes for the search algorithms

## Usage

Each `.c` file can be compiled and run separately. For example, to run the linear search, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o linear
./linear

This will compile the code and run the linear search on a predefined array of integers.
